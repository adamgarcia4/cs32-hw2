	How do the two algorithms differ from each other?
		While both implementations follow the same algorithms, only differing in the data structure type, the order in which the coordinates are popped off the stack differ.  In both implementations, at any given coordinate, the algorithm stores available moves in the North/East/South/West direction order.  However, the difference between these two algorithms are the order in which the next node is accessed from the data structure.

		In the Stack implementation, which employs a LIFO implementation, the available nodes are popped off the stack in a West/South/East/North order.

		In the Queue implementation, which employs a FIFO implementation, the available nodes are dequeued in a North/East/South/West order.

		This difference in the implementation is why the order that nodes are accessed is very different.
